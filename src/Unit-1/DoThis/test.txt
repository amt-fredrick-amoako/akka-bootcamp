I want to try something here.
Tell me that you've had enough.
Just give me a reason.
Just a little bit is enough.
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from. 
It's all in your mind.
You've been having real bad dreams.
There is nothing more than empty sheets between our love.

Did it work
I think it did.
Oh red o red 
a gun to your head head to your head
now all i see is red red red
did you really just say she didn't mean anything
oh
I'll remember those words when I come for your soul,
you're a fool
you dug your own grave now ly in it, 
you'r so cruel
it's always nice to you.
